**Project Overview: **This python project is a personal and independent project to make audio files easy to visualise for studio editing. It uses custom tkinter to allow the user to choose an audio file, specifically an MP3 file. It is then taken to a new display, where the user is given access to playback controls, such as volume and play/pause, as well as an audio visualiser, showing the different frequencies of the audio file. It combines mathematics, signal processing and creativity to produce a visually engaging audio experience.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.14
- Pygame (pip)
- Custom TKinter (pip)
- Windows 10 or above
- Minimum 4GB RAM

**What I have learned:**
- How to analyse audio files with FFT
- How to create custom GUIs with Custom TKinter
- How to implement audio playback with corresponding controls

**Future Improvements:**
- Learn to switch between bars and smoothed lines
- Learn to export visualised audios as video files
